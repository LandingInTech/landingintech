# Discord Community

You might be asking, why join the community?

First of, we are a bunch of folks that enjoy helping others grow in tech. We talk about anything related to tech. About books that we are reading, or things that we are working on.

We are also kicking off some cool content to get the community involved:

- Monthly meetups/discussions about a specific topic
- Study groups
- Book clubs
- Hanging out and chat in the voice chat

As being part of the community, you will also be the first one to know when and who the next guest(s) are!
