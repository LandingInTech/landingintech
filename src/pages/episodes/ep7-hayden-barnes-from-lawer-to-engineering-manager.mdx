## Description

On this episode, Haylen Barnes shares his journey from being a lawyer to becoming an engineering manager at canonical. We talk about windows, windows subsystem for Linux, WSLconf and all things Linux.

Hayden shows how his tinkering and hacking mentality opened a door in his career that he didn't even consider. How his project Pewgin came to be and how working on it landed a job offer from Canonical.

He also shares great pieces of advice for anyone that wants to differentiate itself from others. How important finding a niche and creating content. Hayden also talks about the dangers of turning your hobbies into a job.
